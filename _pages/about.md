I am Guoguo Zhang, currently pursuing a Master of Music in Piano Performance at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. My research spans performance practice, artificial intelligence, human–computer interaction, neuroscience, and cognitive science. I focus on multimodal affective computing and generative music, with applications in real-time systems, digital humans, and clinical music therapy. Grounded in neuroscience and cognitive science, my work aims to create interactive, emotion-aware musical systems that enhance human–computer interaction and support both therapeutic and artistic creation.
