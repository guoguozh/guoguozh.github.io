excerpt: "As overall technical lead, architected a low-latency, closed-loop Music Therapy system which is deployed at the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Court. It streams high-fidelity EEG and audio, performs robust artifact rejection and feature extraction, and fuses neural and acoustic signals with a Transformer to drive a moment-to-moment generative music controller. Added 30 fps facial-affect estimation and voice-prosody analysis, then designed reliability-aware multimodal fusion so the controller adapts in real time and quantifies therapeutic response. These contributions reflect uncommon command of modern AI and production ML. The result is production-grade accuracy and robustness, as evidenced by successful enterprise deployment. Equally important, shows strong algorithmic maturity—deriving and implementing cross-modal alignment, calibration, and online inference strategies."
