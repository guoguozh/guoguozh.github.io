excerpt: "Architected and executed a modular, ultra-low-latency pipeline for avatar rendering and full-duplex A/V via WebRTC, implementing an asyncio-based streaming stack that reliably sustains 30 fps video and 16 kHz audio for a tight perception-action loop. The system has been demonstrated and deployed at the China Post Group. It is a lab-to-field translation that showcases uncommon ability to turn research into robust, production-grade systems."
