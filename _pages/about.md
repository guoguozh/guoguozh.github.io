I am an undergraduate student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST), currently working with Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/) on the topic related to Diffusion Model. I will obtain BEng in Computer Science in Jun 2025. My research interests are in the areas of computer vision and machine learning, especially generative model. Currently I am focusing on diffusion model for video.

I am looking for a Job / MPhil / PhD position now!
