I am Guoguo Zhang, a Master of Music student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where I focus on Piano Performance with a special interest in the intersection of AI, music, and human-computer interaction.

My research interests span AI for Music & HCI, including multimodal affective computing, generative music & digital humans, and timbre transfer. I work with deep learning and representation learning methods, with applications in real-time systems and applied vision for scientific imaging. I am also interested in cognitive science and its intersection with music and technology.

At the core of my work is a passion for piano performance, where I explore both classical and contemporary repertoire. Beyond performance, I am deeply engaged in research that bridges music, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. My projects include developing AI-based music therapy systems with clinical deployments, real-time digital human dialogue systems, and investigating the cognitive mechanisms underlying musical perception and emotion.

My interdisciplinary approach combines insights from neuroscience and cognitive science to understand how music affects the human mind and brain. I am particularly interested in how musical interventions can be used in therapeutic contexts, examining the psychophysiological mechanisms that underlie music’s impact on cognition, emotion, and behavior.

Through my work, I aim to contribute to both the advancement of AI technologies for music and the understanding of music’s role in human cognition and well-being. I am passionate about creating interactive systems that enhance human-computer interaction through multimodal interfaces, emotion recognition, and personalized musical experiences.
