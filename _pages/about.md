I am Guoguo Zhang, a Master of Music student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where I focus on Piano Performance with a special interest in the intersection of AI, music, and human-computer interaction.

My research interests span **AI for Music & HCI**, including multimodal affective computing, generative music & digital humans, and timbre transfer. I work with deep learning and representation learning methods, with applications in real-time systems and applied vision for scientific imaging. I am also interested in cognitive science and its intersection with music and technology.
